* Miriam is an open-source instrument for isothermal amplification reactions based on the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) platform. Miriam can run assays based on LAMP or Elisa protocols by running the master program locally on your computer and connecting it via USB or through the [Miroculus](http://www.miroculus.com/) interface via WiFi, that will be available during the summer of 2016.
The open-source master program for serial interface can be downloaded for free at http://www.github.com/miroculus. From there also the different firmwares for WiFi communication are available.

* Comparison of negative and positive controls in qPCR and Miriam (y, RFU and x, cycle (2min)):

* The optics have been designed for this calcein dye: http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/products/fluore/index.html. 

* The lower concentration we have validated is 2amol (y, Normalized signal and x, cycle (2min)):
