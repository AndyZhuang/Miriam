* Miriam is an open-source instrument for isothermal amplification reactions based on the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) platform. Miriam can run assays based on LAMP or Elisa protocols by running the master program locally on your computer and connecting it via USB.
The open-source master program for serial interface can be found [here](http://www.github.com/miroculus/Miriam/). 

* The optics have been designed for [calcein dye](http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/products/fluore/index.html). 

* The lower concentration we have validated is 2amol (y, Normalized signal and x, cycle (1min)):
