* Miriam is an open-source instrument for isothermal amplification reactions based on the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) platform. Miriam can run assays based on LAMP or Elisa protocols by running the master program locally on your computer and connecting it via USB or through the [Miroculus](http://www.miroculus.com/) interface via WiFi, that will be available during the summer of 2016.
The open-source master program can be downloaded for free at http://www.github.com/miroculus
